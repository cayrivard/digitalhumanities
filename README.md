## Short Biography

I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Italian Studies at McGill as I complete a first M.A. in English Literature at Carleton University. My academic background is a mixture of literary studies and modern languages, with a preference for working with English and Italian poetry written between 1300 and 1700 (especially in the longer narrative forms, such as epic). I am most interested in movement and change as they appear within descriptions of perfect worlds (e.g. heaven, the garden of Eden) and the 'ideal' human life, as well as in the broader sense of the *translatio* of Renaissance habits of thought from the European continent (particularly Italy) to England via the circulation and reinscription of texts. A secondary research interest in Italian cultural production during the Mussolini regime (specifically the renewed assertions of control over cultural heritage, especially of Dante) has inspired the commencement of my second M.A. degree, during which I hope to indulge my fascination with this most bizarre moment in Italian cultural production whilst continuing to pursue a greater understanding of the relation between English and Italian Renaissance texts.
