## Short Biography

I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Italian Studies at McGill as I complete a first M.A. in English Literature at Carleton University. My academic background is a mixture of literary studies and modern languages, with a preference for working with English and Italian poetry written between 1300 and 1700 (especially in the longer narrative forms, such as epic). I am most interested in movement and change as they appear within descriptions of perfect worlds (e.g. heaven, the garden of Eden) and the 'ideal' human life, as well as in the broader sense of the *translatio* of Renaissance habits of thought from the European continent (particularly Italy) to England via the circulation and reinscription of texts. A secondary research interest in Italian cultural production during the Mussolini regime (specifically the renewed assertions of control over cultural heritage, especially of Dante) has inspired the commencement of my second M.A. degree, during which I hope to indulge my fascination with this most bizarre moment in Italian cultural production whilst continuing to pursue a greater understanding of the relation between English and Italian Renaissance texts.

## My Research Project

The project I intend to commence during my Italian M.A. and expand into an eventual Ph.D. dissertation is an examination of the Italian texts most translated into English and in circulation in England during the Renaissance period. These three texts are Boccaccio's *Decameron*, Matteo Bandello's *Novelle*, and Giraldi Cinthio's *Hecatommithi*. By comparing the English translations of these texts to their Italian originals, I hope to demonstrate that there is a similar dynamic between a translated text and its original and literary allusion, insofar as both types of engagement with a source text result in a reinscription of the original which reveals English responses to and tensions with Italian intellectual and literary influence.

## My Objectives

* to better acquaint myself with the digital humanities
* to learn new ways to present and disseminate research in the digital age
* to experiment with techniques of digital scholarship
* to develop new skills
