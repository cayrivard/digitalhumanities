Building on recent work in the digital humanities such as the Viral Texts project and the Digital Breadcrumbs of the Brothers Grimm, Reeve, Terlunen and Eckert are applying text reuse detection technology to trace the critical reception history of George Eliot’s *Middlemarch* through quotations of the novel present in academic articles. Through the current focus on *Middlemarch* alone, the three scholars seek to present a new methodology for approaching and quantifying the critical reception history of source texts through their direct quotation. The method would permit scholars to track with increased precision the exact phrases most cited from a given source text as well as trends in the location and density of citations over time, and could be applied to a wide variety of types of quotations (in scholarly studies, non-academic nonfiction, other literary works, etc.) as well as to earlier periods of literary reception.

Available as both a web service and a standalone desktop application, Juxta enables users to compare and collate multiple versions of a written text. The software was originally designed to help scholars and editors trace the history of a given text, though it can be used for any number of comparative textual scholarship purposes. Users begin by creating a comparison set of textual witnesses and choosing a base text for collation; the base text can be changed at will, and users can add or remove textual witnesses from a comparison set as needed, allowing users significant flexibility to tailor the collation to answer specific inquiries. Once collated, the comparative data generated can be analytically visualized in several different ways. The default display of results is a heat map of all textual variants, although other options include side-by-side collation of the base text and one witness as well as a histogram of Juxta collations that displays the density of all variation from the base text, allowing for the efficient localization of passages with substantial levels of variation. The more complete desktop version (compatible with Mac, Windows, and Unix as long as Java 1.5 is installed) also allows users to annotate specific comparisons and save the results of a given collation.
